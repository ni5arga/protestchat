title: Get running (5 minutes)
description: Install protestchat, add one contact, verify, and send a message with the network off.

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Goal: two phones talking with **airplane mode on** and Bluetooth back on. No account. No server.

<Aside type="caution">
Expo Go will **not** work. You need a real build of the app (development build or a signed release when one is published). Until a download page exists, someone technical must build from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ni5arga/protestchat) — see the README there.
</Aside>

## Before you start

- Charge both phones
- Install the app on both
- Grant Bluetooth (and Location on older Android — only used so Bluetooth scanning works)
- Stand next to each other for the first setup

## First session

<Steps>

1. **Cut the network for real**

   Airplane mode on both phones, then turn **Bluetooth back on**. Wi‑Fi can stay off. Open a browser once to confirm you have no internet.

2. **Open protestchat on both phones**

   Keep the app in the **foreground**. If you switch away, the phone may stop finding peers or relaying.

3. **Add each other**

   On phone A: **Add a person → My code** (show the QR).  
   On phone B: **Add a person → Scan theirs**.  
   Then swap so each has the other.

   Do this face to face. That meeting is how you know who you are talking to — there is no company verifying anyone.

4. **Verify (do not skip)**

   Open the chat → tap the **Not verified yet** strip → compare the safety number on both screens. If the numbers match, mark verified. If they differ, stop — someone may be in the middle.

5. **Send a test message**

   The home banner should show a connected phone. Send a short message. It should arrive in a second or two with no internet.

</Steps>

## Quick checks that matter

| Check | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Walk apart, send, walk back | Message waits, then delivers when you meet again |
| Three phones, A and C never meet | B in the middle can relay if the app stays open |
| **Everyone nearby** | Every phone with the app can read it — including hostile ones |

Next: [choose the right mode](/modes/) and read [your responsibility](/responsibility/).
